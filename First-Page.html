    <h2>Problems and Troubleshooting</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When you save files and see it didn't change. Try to refresh page or check URL path and your file name.</li>
        <li>Weird characters is happening when you copy and paste some code then a lot of the characters don't translate exactly the way you hoped and the number one culprit is the ***quotes***. Try to typing codes by yourself.</li>
